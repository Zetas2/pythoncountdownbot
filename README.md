## How to use

Well, github is being mean, so you need to create your own .env file. The content should be this:

```
\# .env

DISCORD_TOKEN=YourLongAndComplicatedToken
```

## History

This bot is a new version of the old Live Countdown made by the legendary _LordBusiness_. Main reason was since the old one didnt have support for slash commands, but discord would go on and require them.
